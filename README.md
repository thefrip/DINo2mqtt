# DINo2mqtt
An MQTT implementation for Arduino compatible DINo board

Inspired from https://github.com/fr00ller/DINo_MQTT

## Library reference:
- MQTT Arduino library: https://github.com/knolleary/pubsubclient
- EthernetENC: https://github.com/jandrassy/EthernetENC (used to drive ENC28j60 ethernet ic)


## NB. 
The code is only tested whit the KMTronic DINo realy board, but it should work with any board based on ENC28J60 .
